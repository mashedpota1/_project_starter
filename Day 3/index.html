        <h1>Becoming a TechBro</h1> 
        <small>Kawthar Ahmed</small>
        <p> I am Kawthar Ahmed, a 24 year old woman, lover of the arts, technology, and everything that makes the world a better place. I am a gender advocate who believes in, and fights for equality of all genders. I was born in Lagos, Nigeria; an overcrowded and polluted city in Africa. A place perfect in its imperfections. It is perfect because for over 20 years of my life, it was the place i called home. The people, the scenery, the waters, the art, the traffic. Everything was woven into the very fabric of my existence. But somehow, for very tangible reasons, I had to leave. Now I call a very unfamiliar city, "home"

            I am the first child of 6 children, and I carry a burden too big for my tiny shoulders. Don't get me wrong, my siblings are the light of my life, but I'm too young to be an assistant parent. I have however come to realise that, an African frist born child has no escape route from all the hefty responsibilities. We have been wired to face it, and fight like hell to keep our mental health intact.
            
            I attended the Obafemi Awolowo University, a very prestegious institution in Nigeria. There, i bagged my BA in History and International Relations. Since then, I have dabbled into a lot of things. I have worked as an OAP for an Islamic Online Radio, I nurtured my love for pottery and painting, I have worked as a film producer at a media organisation, I handled digital media marketing for an advertising and corporate communications firm, and I managed projects for a gender advocacy organisation.
            In between all of these, I stumbled on a call for applicants to join a programme called "Andela Learning Community" It was a training, supported by Google, with the aim to train young people in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enrolled and, got in. My training days were however shortlived as I had no laptop to work with. It was painful, as I was thrilled to learn something fresh. And my dreams to demystify how the web works wasn't going to come true. I kept hope alive, and now I am here, trying to complete this exercise for the CodeMaster Bootcamp.</p>

        <p>I have tried several times to be specialised in a particular field. To stick to that profession and set my goals around it. I have however found out that I am so many things, and I'd rather follow my curiousity than be held down by one thing. I guess this is why I became drawn to software development. The possibilities are endless. And when equiped with the right skills, one can realistically widen their dreams, goals and aspirations. These are my goals for the next three years:</p>
